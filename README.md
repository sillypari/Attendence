# Attendence
I wanted to create an automatic attendence process for students in class 

Key Features : 
- Takes students.txt list and reads and display it on ouput
- press y or n for present or absent (Pressing entering to by default make it present)
- The final report is exported as ATNDC-Date-Subject.txt
- Which includes : Date and time stamp of attendence and no of students Present and absent also name of only absent students

Note : 
- the text file containing list of students must be :
- named "students.txt"
- format of name : {salutation}{First Name}{Middile Name}{Last name}

  Cheers :)
  Will make it better!
